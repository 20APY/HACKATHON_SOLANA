## HACKATHON SOLANA

20APY is a DeFi startup that issues a stablecoin backed by Visa and Mastercard receivables.

We stake with a yield of 20% per year, and use the capital to finance performed credit operations for small businesses.

The credit card market in Brazil is worth US$250 billion and has seen constant growth at rates above 10% per year.

We have a team with over 30 years of experience in financial services and digital product development. We have been dedicated to the startup since 2022; we have created a credit intermediation machine and have intermediated over US$30 million.

In addition to being credit intermediaries, we will provide capital to our clients with the capital obtained through our Token Bonds.

Our main business model will be the spread between investment and credit, which gives us a revenue of 489% for every US$1 issued in our stablecoin.

We also have credit intermediation business models where we earn 5% of the volume, and 1% of the wallet transfer fee from our stablecoin.

In the next 10 years we will grant US$100 billion in credit, and to do so we will enter into other types of credit.

Our business model is based on resolution 4,734/2019 of the Central Bank of Brazil, which establishes conditions and procedures for carrying out discount operations on payment arrangement receivables that are part of the Brazilian Payment System.
